A wrapper to send data over stdin to utilities that don't use stdin. It's
similar xargs but it stores the data in a temp file rather than pass the data
directly as command line arguments.

farg geeqie < image.png
This command reads reads image.png on stdin, writes it to a temp file, and
calls geeqie with the temp file as an argument.

A more realistic use case is with mutt's pipe-entry. Attachments can be opened
in geeqie using:
|farg geeqie
